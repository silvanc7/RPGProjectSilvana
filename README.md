# RPGProjectSilvana

Text-based RPG game

## Description

The user will be abducted by Jigsaw and awaken in an unfamiliar residence. This program will compel the user to participate in Jigsaw’s game by presenting them with randomized riddle questions from the file_name.txt. The user will have five attempts to solve each riddle question encountered in each room. Upon successfully solving each riddle question without exhausting their attempts, the user will be released. Conversely, if the user exhausts all their attempts in a single riddle, they will be eliminated by Jigsaw. The user will face two possible outcomes: survival or eternal confinement within the house.

## Instructions

Open the 'py' in Visual Studio Code. Once there open the main.py. Open the Terminal, and on the terminal, write 'python main.py,' and press enter to start the game.

Once the user gets to this point the user will enter a number(1 or 2) from the menu selection.

After the user inputs a number (for example, 1), the user will read a note, which is a short description of the game's instructions.
Then the game will prompt the user to answer a word riddle.

If the user answers incorrectly, they will get to attempt to answer again. However, each time, they will get fewer tries until they die.

This is when the user attempts their last try and dies afterward. They will also have the option to play again if they input yes, if not, the program will end.

However, if the user answers correctly, they will continue to the next room to find another riddle.

When the user reaches the final room (living room) and answers correctly, they will win the game! And have the choice to play again.
